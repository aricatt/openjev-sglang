# BoolQ calibration evaluation

Run all 3,270 labeled development examples against OpenJev and optionally real Jev.
These are standalone uv scripts: their dependencies stay separate from the API's
environment. No server redeployment is needed to run an evaluation.

```sh
# OpenJev: 16 concurrent requests, with a short pause per worker.
uv run evals/boolq.py --concurrency 16

# Real Jev: reads ~/.openrouter-api-key locally; sends it only to OpenRouter.
uv run evals/boolq.py --provider jev --concurrency 16 --output evals/runs/boolq-jev

# Paired report, PNG and PDF plots, and machine-readable metrics.
uv run evals/report_boolq.py --jev evals/runs/boolq-jev

# OpenJev report without a comparison endpoint.
uv run evals/report_boolq.py
```

Collection writes each successful prediction immediately to JSONL and resumes
completed rows on rerun. It refuses to reuse a directory with a different
protocol. Transient network and capacity errors receive bounded retries; a
permanent failure stops the run. The report requires all rows, so failed requests
cannot silently disappear from the denominator. `--limit 5 --output
evals/runs/pilot` runs a small pilot. `--concurrency 1` reduces load further.
The default concurrency is 2; up to 64 is configurable. Concurrency can change
when resuming a run; `execution.jsonl` records each segment's settings and starting
row count, while the manifest preserves the original run settings.

The source is [Google's BoolQ](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/boolean-questions),
mirrored at `google/boolq` on Hugging Face, pinned to revision
`35b264d03638db9f4ce671b711558bf7ff0f80d5`. The original Google download currently
requires access; the public parquet mirror supplies passage, question and answer.
Its `validation` split corresponds to BoolQ's labeled development set; official
test answers are hidden. The dataset license is CC BY-SA 3.0. Downloaded data and
raw run outputs are ignored by git.

The passage is `state`; the question instruction is `Based on the passage, answer
this yes/no question:\n{question}`. Both providers receive explicit Yes/No
criteria. The gold answer is never sent to the API. We score `noul` as P(yes).
No calibration parameters are fitted, and the entropy-based `confidence` field
is not used. The providers can use different internal prompts and inference
procedures despite receiving equivalent payloads.

Metrics include accuracy, binary Brier score, log loss, two forms of ten-bin ECE,
mean overconfidence, and errors above 90%, 95% and 99% selected-answer probability.
The report includes 2,000 paired bootstrap samples clustered by passage, reliability
plots with approximate binwise Wilson intervals, and bin counts. Brier/log loss
measure predictive skill as well as calibration. ECE depends on binning and has
finite-sample bias. Results describe passage-grounded yes/no classification;
public benchmark overlap with model training is unknown.

Every run records the dataset byte hash, source revision, exact prompt, provider,
requested model ID, response model IDs, usage, retries and request IDs. API key
contents are never written to the results.

## MMLU-Pro subset

```sh
uv run evals/mmlu_pro.py --count 1000 --seed 42 --concurrency 16
uv run evals/mmlu_pro.py --provider openjev --count 1000 --seed 42 --concurrency 16

# Preserve the previous run when testing a new deployment.
uv run evals/mmlu_pro.py --provider openjev --output evals/runs/mmlu-pro-openjev-simple-options
uv run evals/compare_mmlu_pro.py
```

This standalone script samples test questions uniformly without replacement and
uses Jev's or OpenJev's `choice` endpoint with zero-shot direct answers. Each
provider gets its own output directory; OpenJev waits for server readiness and
never reads or sends the OpenRouter key. It reports exact-match
accuracy, an approximate Wilson interval, and subject breakdowns. It is not a
reproduction of the usual five-shot chain-of-thought benchmark protocol. The
manifest records the pinned dataset revision, byte hash and all sampled indices.
Predictions resume on rerun; incomplete runs cannot produce a final report.
The comparison script verifies matching questions and payload settings, then
produces a subject dot plot, overall Wilson intervals, a paired outcome grid,
and paired bootstrap intervals for score differences. Its default inputs are the
saved Jev run, the original OpenJev run, and the new prompt run shown above.

## One-token prompt research

[Research findings and results](results/mmlu-pro-research-2026-09-18/report.md)
include the five prompt variants, a KV-cache audit, and a proposed bounded-reasoning
experiment.

`prompt_probe.py` compares the deployed prompt, a plain MCQ, a JSON answer prefix,
five validation examples with direct answers, and five validation examples with
rationales. Every test answer still uses exactly one generated token with thinking
disabled. This diagnostic calls the internal SGLang endpoint through an existing
Modal container; it does not change the deployment or expose a new endpoint.

```sh
# First cache test data using mmlu_pro.py. Also download the validation split:
curl -L --fail -o evals/data/mmlu-pro-validation.parquet \
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro/resolve/b189ec765aa7ed75c8acfea42df31fdae71f97be/data/validation-00000-of-00001.parquet
uv run modal container list
uv run evals/prompt_probe.py --container ta-... --output evals/runs/prompt-research
```

The default 256 questions exclude the earlier 1,000-question sample. This is an
exploratory comparison, not a new headline benchmark: any selected improvement
needs confirmation on untouched questions. Test gold answers remain local; only
the official validation examples supply demonstration answers. The script records
all five variants and paired bootstrap intervals, and fails if any result is missing.
Use a new output directory for each run. Raw output is streamed into `remote.log`;
this bounded diagnostic does not resume or retry failed requests.

## Bounded-reasoning probe

[Saved comparison and latency plot](results/thinking-2026-09-18/report.md).

```sh
uv run evals/thinking_probe.py --container ta-... --output evals/runs/thinking-128
uv run evals/report_thinking.py evals/runs/thinking-128 --output evals/results/thinking
```

This small experiment compares 0, 64, 256, and 1,024 reasoning tokens on 128 new
questions, excluding both earlier samples. It does not change the production API.
All budgets use the same plain MCQ and JSON final-answer format. Positive budgets
enable Qwen's native thinking template, stop at `</think>` or the token cap, then
append a closed thinking block and score one final answer token. Reasoning uses
Qwen's recommended general-task sampling settings and a per-question seed.
Final answers are selected by argmax over the letter logprobs.

Budgets run separately at concurrency 16. Reported latency is measured inside the
container for reasoning plus the answer call; it excludes the external API path,
the client-side concurrency queue, and cold startup. Raw generated reasoning is
saved locally in the ignored run directory. The script records accuracy, paired
bootstrap intervals, p50/p95 latency, tokens used, and natural completion counts.
This is an exploratory latency/accuracy comparison, not a reproduction of Qwen's
published benchmark or a calibration evaluation. Requests are not retried; any
missing result prevents a final report. Use a fresh output directory on rerun.

## Hosted one-token MMLU-Pro

```sh
uv run evals/mmlu_pro_openrouter.py
```

This evaluates Qwen3.8-27B through OpenRouter, pinned to Parasail at concurrency 16,
using the exact earlier 1,000-question sample and the key in
`~/.openrouter-api-key`. It needs the saved baseline manifests/predictions and the
cached test parquet. Requests disable reasoning and cap generation at one token;
responses must explicitly report one output token and zero reasoning tokens.
The plain zero-shot prompt and request settings are recorded in the manifest.

Predictions use the highest-logprob exact uppercase answer letter in the top-20
list. If any answer letter appears, its ranking over all other answer letters is
known, including letters outside the top-20. If none appears, the question is
marked unresolved and counted wrong. No omitted probability is assumed zero, and
no calibration metrics are computed from this truncated distribution.

The run resumes from saved responses; only transient request failures are retried.
The report checks matching dataset hashes, question IDs/indices, gold labels and
subjects, then compares accuracy and paired bootstrap differences against Jev and
OpenJev. Their prompt wrappers and serving backends differ, so this is a service
comparison, not an isolated model ablation. Raw responses stay in the ignored run
directory; summary metrics and plots go in `evals/results/qwen38-27b/`.
